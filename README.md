### 📊 **Forecasting Community Representation in Media Using LSTM**

This project is focused on predicting future trends in the representation of diverse communities—such as African, Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, and European—across three major domains of media: **News Channels**, **Social Media Platforms**, and **Entertainment Media (TV/Movies)**.

Using historical data scraped from global media sources between 2004 and 2024, this project applies deep learning (LSTM) models to forecast community visibility for the next decade (2025–2035). The predictions are displayed via a user-friendly Flask web app that allows users to select a media type, community, and input past representation data.

💡 **Key Features:**

* Custom-trained LSTM models per community for sequence-based prediction
* Dynamic frontend built with HTML, JavaScript, and Chart.js for visualization
* Interactive UI with dropdowns for platform/community selection
* Forecast graphs and auto-generated summary messages for insights
* Aims to help researchers, policymakers, and media houses monitor and address representational bias

🔍 **Research Goal:**
To reduce underrepresentation and highlight long-term diversity trends using explainable AI. The project also includes engagement metrics and performance benchmarking using AMAPE and R² scores against other forecasting models like ARIMA and Prophet.
